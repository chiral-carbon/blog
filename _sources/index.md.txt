# Abhipsha Das

Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am interested in applications of machine learning and am learning a bit more about it everyday. I am also a tad bit interested in quantum computing. I made this website in the hopes of letting the constant blabber in my head escape, and since it has become very easy for all of us to be lonely and reclusive in this pandemic, I hope writing here breaks me out of that.

I work(ed) as a machine learning engineer at a fintech in the past but I am more inclined to pursue a research oriented project. I am currently looking for research assistant/intern positions in the fields of natural language processing, statistical modelling and also quantum machine learning. If you have any open spots in your research team or someone you know does then please let me know! I can be contacted at abhipsha dot das16 at gmail.
