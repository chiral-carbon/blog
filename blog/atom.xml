    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It should come as no surprise to anyone that writing about oneself is a conspicuously difficult thing to do no matter how facile it may seem on surface. Yet by a stroke of (incredibly good) luck here I am, doing a self-introduction online despite my unreasonable aversion to being perceived, as ludicrous as that may sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many things, however, that I could say about myself. I am easily distracted, largely indecisive and interested in pursuing too many varied things. I have a propensity to vacillate between having an outburst of inititative and doing nothing at all. I prefer cold weather to hot and I really hope to be able to play Paganini’s Caprices on the violin one day. I do not understand a thing about web development and am endlessly fascinated (but woefully underinformed) by artificial intelligence and its applications. I love learning languages and learning about languages, and I am perpetually trying to understand my relative position and privilege in the world. I would like to read more history, politics and visit every corner of the world, and feel happy to just &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; - without having to attach the worth of my life to what I accomplish or don’t accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Everyone Struggles, But Everyone Believes They Are The Only One Struggling</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While I have had a very curious interest in FOSS since almost the beginning of my time at university, and tried to follow it up by looking at projects that intrigued me, I was never able to contribute to anything largely due to my inability to ask (read: fear of asking) questions like what a beginner like me could do. I often did not know how to structure my thoughts and questions in a way that the maintainers understood - beyond the initial “hey! I am a beginner in xyz and would love to work on this project” - because what I probably wished for is someone to assign me a task and list out all the prerequisites I’d need to fulfill it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since anyone reading this will know that that is not how open source exactly works - not that maintainers don’t help you out, quite the opposite, but delegating unresolved issues to newcomers like a teacher would do to their students is not how it goes. Any contributor needs to be more proactive in claiming issues, recognizing bugs, and approaching the project as a whole.
Now what should people who really do want to be proactive in such a manner but actually feel lost and clueless do? I was one of them, and I can say that I continue to be like that. When I began my journey with Outreachy through the contribution period, after making sure that I had some interest in the PyMC project, I claimed issues without thinking much at all. I was encouraged by my mentor to scan through the many many open issues and chose the ones that seemed the simplest, and haven’t stopped learning and working since.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s been a few months since I began contributing to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc-examples"&gt;pymc-examples&lt;/a&gt; and the experience so far has been enlightening. For someone who previously could only covetously look upon my fellow classmates as they contributed away to open source projects while I was still struggling with git and the jargon used in a project, I feel like I have come a relatively long way, thanks in no small part to the PyMC community members. I have gained some understanding of Bayesian inference and statistical concepts while updating the example notebooks, which are a set of jupyter notebooks hosted for the reference of newcomers trying to do probabilistic programming with PyMC3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some context, Bayesian inference means drawing statistical inferences using &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem"&gt;Bayes’ theorem&lt;/a&gt; to update the probability of a premise/hypothesis as and when we obtain more evidence for our defined premise. We define a statistical model for our data based on which a likelihood function and prior probability is derived, and based on these two, a posterior probability is obtained. It is a common and convenient way to update our hypothesis inside a statistical framework. So the steps of Bayesian inference can be summarized as: get observed data, build a probabilistic model to represent the data, specify prior distributions and apply Bayes’ theorem for inference and updating our hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thinking about my future career is as daunting to me as any person in their 20s - laden with anxiety, uncertainty and still with a lot of optimism. Most of the times the anxiety part of it wins though and I am left with a lot of hours of overthinking. And the fact that applications and contacting people are such stressful processes hardly helps the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had always wanted to have a career in academia and pursue research, and have from the beginning of my undergrad been interested in machine learning. It is a vast field in itself and has so many cross-discipline applications that it sometimes leaves me confused since I have no idea what I would like the most to study. This made me wonder about taking up jobs or internships to rake up some experience and gain more of a nuanced understanding of the industry, but while they have been invaluable experiences, I am nowhere near sorted out in my head.&lt;/p&gt;
