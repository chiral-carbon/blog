&lt;p&gt;There are many things, however, that I could say about myself. I am easily distracted, largely indecisive and interested in pursuing too mnay varied things. I have a propensity to vacillate between having an outburst of inititative and doing nothing at all. I prefer cold weather to hot and I really hope to be able to play Paganini’s Caprices on the violin one day. I do not understand a thing about web development and am endlessly fascinated (but woefully underinformed) by artificial intelligence and its applications. I love learning languages and learning about languages, and I am perpetually trying to understand my relative position and privilege in the world. I would like to read more history, politics and visit every corner of the world, and feel happy to just &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt;- without having to attach the worth of my life to what I accomplish or don’t accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
