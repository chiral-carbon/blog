# About me

I graduated in 2020 with a degree in Computer Science from IIIT Bhubaneswar with no great accomplishments other than finding my best friend. I dabbled in a bunch of things but have been most inclined to study machine learning and its applications, but the field is so vast that till today I am lost as to which of my inclinations to pursue. 

I started playing the violin recently, and though I sound just a little bit better than scratching nails on a chalkboard, I have huge ambitions to one day nail Paganini's Caprice No. 2. Wish me luck!


## About this website

This website is heavily (almost entirely) inspired by [Chris Holdgraf's personal website](https://predictablynoisy.com/), though I plan to play around with the style if I ever figure out how CSS works. 

It uses the [pydata sphinx theme](https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/) along with [ablog](https://ablog.readthedocs.io/) for blogging, and the [myst-parser](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [myst-nb](https://myst-nb.readthedocs.io/) packages for writing posts in Markdown and Jupyter Notebooks.
